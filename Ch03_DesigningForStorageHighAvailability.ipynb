There might be a situation where you will want to enable read access to the data in the secondary region without initiating a failover. You can do so with the use of read‑access geo‑redundant storage or read‑access geo‑zone‑redundant storage. These two options provide a way to gain read access at all times to your data within your secondary zone.

Basically, all you need to do is provide the details for your disk, and Microsoft will handle the storage account creation and will manage the disk for you. Details for your disk are as follows.

The concept behind this is placing disks in different storage scale units. If one unit becomes unavailable, the other storage scale units will take it from there.

For those of you working with virtual machines, not just within the Azure portal, but in general, chances are that you're already familiar with the concept of a virtual disk snapshot. A snapshot is an exact copy of the virtual hard drive attached to a virtual machine. You can take a snapshot of the OS disk or any other data disk.

    "In this demonstration, we will see how to protect virtual machines by enabling backups, and we'll see how to get started using Azure Site Recovery. I've already selected the virtual machine for which I want to enable backups. From the left pane, search for the Backup option. From here, as I do not have an existing Recovery Services vault, I'll simply create a new one. I'll keep the same Resource group, and then I'll click on Create a new policy to see the options available. I could configure the Backup schedule from here, as well as the Retention range. Once everything is configured according to your needs, simply Enable Backup. In the previous clip, we got an overview of Site Recovery, and we've learned that it could replicate virtual machines to another region. To access Azure Site Recovery, click on Disaster recovery. From here, I could select the target region. Let's say I want to replicate my VM in another part of the U.S., I'll select West US. By scrolling down, we can get a world map view of the available regions. We see the flow here indicating the source and target regions where the virtual machine will be replicated. Let's click on Advanced settings, Azure will create a new VM resource group, as well as a new Virtual network. It will also create a new cache storage account and two replica managed disks. You can click on Show details to see exactly what will be created. I can see both disks attached to my virtual machine. I could specify the disk type for the replica. I could also decide not to include a disk for replication. Under Replication settings, let's click on Show details. A new Recovery services vault will be created, as well as a new Vault resource group. The Replication policy will be set to 24 hours. Finally, under Extension settings we see that an Automation account will also be created to be able to manage the replication process. Once we're done, simply click on Review and Start replication. Here we get the big picture of our Replication settings. I could start a process by clicking on Start replication. This is the end of this clip on enabling virtual machine backups."

    "With this next clip, I will demonstrate how to configure I‑ availability when working with Microsoft Azure SQL databases. In order to do so, we will use geo‑replication. We will build two servers and replicate a database between two locations. Once logged into the Azure portal, get the SQL Databases section. We do not add any database right now. In order to create a new one, select Create SQL database. You can create a new resource group if necessary. In my case, I'll just select a resource group previously created, which is LABM4‑RG. Now is the time to provide information about our new DB. First, I'll provide a name, labm4db. Second, we need to deploy a server. This server will be entirely managed by the Azure team, so no worries about security patching or any other management tasks. The name of the server will be labm401. The name must be unique within the database.windows.net namespace. We now need to provide the server admin username and password and finally select the location, which is in my case, East US. We will not be using SQL elastic pool. This is a nice option when you want to share resources when working with multiple databases, which is not the case here. Next to compute and storage, click on Configure database. From here, you can select between multiple tiers. Depending on your needs, it could be a general‑purpose database or, if you need to be able to use hyperscale, which provides your database with on‑demand scalable storage. If you're planning on running an application with a high transaction rate, you would choose Business Critical. In our case, as this is a lab environment, let's look for the basic tier. It can be found by clicking on the link right here on the left. We now have three options available: basic standard, and premium. Let's select basic. I will keep the default of 5 DTUs or database transaction units. A DTU is essentially a unit of measure. This will be used for performance measurement for a database within a service tier. The measures are a mix of read and write operations and CPU and memory usage. In our case, we'll get a 5 DTU model. I will keep the default parameter of 2GB for the maximum data size. Click on Apply, and then click on Review and Create. You can review the parameters and make sure everything is set according to your needs, and then initiate the deployment by clicking on Create. The deployment is now complete, so I'll just click on a Go to Resource. I can see the server name here if I wanted to connect to the server and manage the database using an application such a SQL Server Management Studio, but for now, we want to replicate this database. Let's go to the Geo‑Replication section. From here, I can select the target region where I want to create the secondary database. From the list of available regions, I'll select West US. We can see that the secondary database will be readable. This means you could set up connections to this database that were read‑only operations. This can help in reducing the number of transactions the primary database has to deal with. For example, you could set up reports based on that secondary database instead of the primary. Now we need a secondary server as well, so let's select Target Server and provide necessary information such as server name, which will be labm402, and username and password for the admin account. Once this is done, click on Select and then click on OK. The deployment will start. We can see here the source location as well as the destination. Once the deployment is complete, you will see a solid link between the two locations. Just below, we can see the status of the replication between both databases. If I click on a context menu, I see I have the ability to either force a failover and make this database available for write and read operations and setting the other database as read‑only. We also have the ability to stop replication. This is the end of this demo on Azure SQL Database geo‑replication."

    "This is already the end of this module. Let's recap on what we've covered so far. We started with the different storage account types. When you are you working within Azure SQL databases or virtual machines, storage is definitely a key component in your architecture. Correctly planning ID available storage is essential. Storage performance is also something that needs to be considered. You could use standard, which is the lowest in cost, and could be used as an example for archiving. You could also choose premium for best performance for applications with rate transactions such as in Azure SQL database."

    "We then got into how Azure replication works, and how multiple copies of your data are replicated to ensure persistence during planned and unplanned maintenance. We've learned the difference between locally, zone, geo, and geo‑zone‑redundant storage. We've seen how to gain read access to the data replicated to a secondary region. Our next topic was virtual machine managed disks, and which types should be used based on different scenarios. We've seen how Azure maintains persistence of your managed disk by keeping three replicas of your data. We continued this module on how to provide high availability and disaster recovery options for virtual machine managed disk. I'm talking here about managed disk snapshots to be able to restore to a previous state or to use a snapshot to create a new managed disk for troubleshooting. We then covered disaster recovery by enabling backup on a virtual machine.. We completed this module on how to configure Azure SQL database geo‑replication to provide high availability to our databases. Now let's jump to the next module on designing for network redundancy."
